      <h2>Understanding File Path</h2>
      <p>Whenever you want to enter image in your website you simply copy its address and paste it in src.</p>
      <p>But what if that image is in your sydtem itself.</p>
      <p>In this case we have to introduce file path.</p>
      <p>There are two types of file path:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Relative path:
            <p>In relative path you need to show the way from the point where you are.</p>
            <p>Suppose you have four folders and files inside them are in the following way:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>root</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>lion.png</li>
                        <li>cat.png</li>
                        <li><h3>Alpha</h3>
                           <ul>
                            <li>dog.png</li>
                            <li>index.html</li>
                            <li><h3>Beta</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>home.html</li>
                                    <li>cow.png</li>
                                    <li><h3>Photos</h3>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>First.png</li>
                                            <li>Second.png</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                           </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <p>Suppose you are writing code in index.html and you want a picture of dog so you simply write src="dog.png or ./dog.png"</p>
        <p>If you want the picture of cow you should write src="Beta/cow.png or ./Beta/cow.png"</p>
        <p>For second picture write src="Beta/Photos/second.png"</p>
        <p>For cat picture write src="../cat.png"</p>
        <p>If you are writing code in home.html for cat picture write src="../../cat.png"</p>
        <p> In relative path also when it is trying to enter in your system then also browser did'nt support relative path.</p>
        <li>Absolute path:
            <p>In absolute path you need to show the way from starting to end.</p>
            <p>Whenever you request for any website and it follows the absolute path to show result in your computer then it start from root to the place where you want to open it.</p>
            <p>So it is dangerous for your computer because the website has access to reach main storage of your computer because in absolute path it starts from zero that's why browser did'nt support absolute path and did'nt show result. </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Why use Boilerplate code?</h2>
      <ol>
